# Spring Boot Project
In this project, we are able to do crud operations and determine whether the user good fit or not for the credit limit.

I planned to use H2 embedded database for be able to get the database without any configuration to any user who would like download and test the project.
Depending on your credit scor, monthly salary and so on. You are getting the message if you are good fit for the credit limit. if you meet the expectations,
you will see the message in the redirect page as well as  with the credit limit you get. 

Have fun :)
